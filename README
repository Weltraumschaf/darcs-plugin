Darcs Plugin for Jenkins CI
===========================

Todo
----
- write more unittests
    - BrowserChooser
- input validation for code browsers URL
- write more javadoc
- improve the changeset index view

Installation
-----------
In the GitHub download section are compiled Jenkins plugins (.hpi) for each version available. 
You can find the darcs.hpi file in side the tar/zip archive. The plugin itself is archived, because
of naming issues: The hpi itsel must be named 'darcs.hpi' without version numbers in the filename.
But to seperate different precompiled plugins they are archived with versioned names.
Download an apropriate archive, unpack it and and upload the resulting darcs.hpi to your Jenkins.

Developers
----------
As prerequisite you need Maven2 installed.

In your ~/.m2/settings.xml you need:

 <settings>
     <pluginGroups>
         <pluginGroup>org.jvnet.hudson.tools</pluginGroup>
     </pluginGroups>
 <settings>

Clone this repo with: git clone git://github.com/Weltraumschaf/jenkins-darcs.git

Change into the repo and run mvn install. After that you can open the pom.xml e.g. in Netbeans and start coding.
