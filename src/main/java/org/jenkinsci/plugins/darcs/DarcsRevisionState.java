 * I think you would be better served by computing the sha1 or md5 of all the hashes as strings.  Relying on Collections.hashCode is dangerous.  Relying on String.hashCode, which is just:
 *
 *     public int hashCode() {
 *         int h = hash;
 *         if (h == 0) {
 *             int off = offset;
 *             char val[] = value;
 *             int len = count;
 *
 *             for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
 *                 h = 31*h + val[off++];
 *             }
 *             hash = h;
 *         }
 *         return h;
 *     }
 *
 * Is going to be a tad weak given that all the characters are from the set [0-9a-f-] i.e. there are only 17 out of 255.
 *
 * The List.hashCode speci is
 *     public int hashCode() {
 *         int hashCode = 1;
 *         Iterator<E> i = iterator();
 *         while (i.hasNext()) {
 *             E obj = i.next();
 *             hashCode = 31*hashCode + (obj==null ? 0 : obj.hashCode());
 *         }
 *         return hashCode;
 *     }
 *
 * Also I would recommend sorting the lists before hashing them.
 *
 * However, if you are looking for a short path to saying there is a difference, the Collections.sort(list1); Collections.sort(list2); if (list1.hashCode() != list2.hashCode()) check should be OK...
 *
 * Just remember that list1.hashCode() == list2.hashCode() does not in anyway claim that there is no change, so you will have to go down the long path anyway.

 * There's utility code in Jenkins that computes MD5 digest of arbitrary byte stream or string. I think that seems like a good and cheap enough hashing for this kind of purpose.
 *
 * Javadoc
 * hudson.Util.getDigestOf()
 * public static String getDigestOf(InputStream source)
 *                          throws IOException
 *
 *    Computes MD5 digest of the given input stream.
